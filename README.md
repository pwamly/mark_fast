# Mark fast !

As developer can't bear to see a proble around me with solution|
and knowing i can help to solve it. I want teachers to easily |
mark and give result to their student very fast. They dont have|
to bother on finding sum and average of the scores. I kwon there|
may be the solution yet out there but not from me, not with my |
styling of tackling it...|

# Some insights !

[1] make sure you you have node 10+
[2] npm install before dare to run it
[3] Open to any advice on the project

# What i hope

that teachers will constrate on marking only and not on summing
up the scores as well dying on result preparation.
